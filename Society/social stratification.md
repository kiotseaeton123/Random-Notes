### Q&A
1. explain how concept of class, caste, meritocracy applies to worldwide societies
* social stratification takes the form of caste in agricultural societies of the past, it takes the form of class and meritocracy in industrialized socities
* The Indian caste system is rooted in Hinduism; by which people are divided by color/varnas, with Brahmans being at the top of the hierarchy
* the brits still have royalty and a priveleged group within the cabinet and upper levels of society in a caste-like manner; but they are a industrialized economy and operates on meritocracy
* the 1917 russian revolution overthrew old feudal estate systems, following in the lead of Marx, who believed that private property was the source of stratification and inequality. The USSR came about and status came to the hands of powerful government officials; in 1985 Gorbachev attempted to decentralize the economy but things didn't work out and in 1991 he was overthrown, then came about the Russian federation
* post wwii 1948 Mao Zedong declared that all work was equally important so the government confiscated all productive property, creating an elite class of powerful and wealthy governmnet officials; 1978 Deng xiaoping loosened the hold on the economy and china developed a market economy and a new class of wealthy business owners emerged; 2012 xi jingping took hold of the communist party; currently in china the new class system consists of the old party hierarchy, a new business hierarchy, and a class of well connected people
2. explain how sociology's major theories apply to social inequality
* structural functionalists like Davis and Moore believe that stratification promotes stability of society, since higher class is given to positions of higher societal importance in the industrialized society, and also because it provides incentive to achieve a higher class by working harder
* social conflicters like Marx believe that the prestige and status that individuals achieve in a capitalist society is a simple reflection of societal inequality; wealthy capitalists replaced aristocrats and proletariats replaced commoners; he belived that the proletariat would eventually rebel against the capitalists because the only thing that industrialized work brught to proletariats was alienation
* social conflicters in the lead of Max Weber preferred a multidimensional view of social stratification; this view incorporates some of the functionalist ideas on the role of stratification in society. Inequality of class should be viewed from wealth and from social aspects like power and prestige; the wealth aspect and the social aspect should not be intermixed because one aspect often follows the other aspect in distinct types of societies(agrarian, industrial...), meaning that one aspect is the driver force of stratification. Weber also noted though, modern societies have a low level of status consistency. Weber's idea of socioeconomic status does something to explain the history of stratification: agrarian societies were stratified by `ascribed` social prestige, industrial societies were stratified by income level, and the appearance of big governments and organizations lead to stratification by power. Socialism never worked because it just changed the driver behind stratification: from status to power, from aristocracy to powerful government officials
3. explain link between tech and stratification
* Lenski's model describes link between tech and stratification: hunting and gathering societies were about survival and there was little surplus, and people had to work together to survive, so there was no stratification. Pastoral and horticultural societies led to surplus and surplus was held in hands of the few; these nobles were like gods over the masses. Industrialization reduced stratification because it brought up the economic level and the level of connectedness among normal people, which is leveraged to gain more legal rights and social rights; meritocracy took hold and weakened the power of ascribed elites. Postindustrial societies see an increase in stratification because government is getting bigger and thus increasing the power dimension of stratification; organizations are getting bigger and thus increasing the wealth dimension of stratification.
* Kuznets curve shows the change in stratification throughout societies of different technological level, but is criticized for using cross sectional data(comparing societies of different levels of economic development). In defense of Kuznets' results, no two states are at the same level of economic development; what Kuznet had to do was to analyze the stage of technological development that the society was experiencing and compare the technological stages to stratification. The Kuznet graph labels it: it is comparing technological development to stratification; it is not comparing stratification across time. If only a single state was graphed on the curve, it would have little meaning for global stratification, more like... state stratification or something.
4. explain distribution of income and wealth in the US
* income: top 20% earns 13x the low 20%; top 20% earns 48% income
* wealth: top 20% has 89% 
* 5% in upper class, 45% in middle class, 35% in working class, 20% in lower class
5. explain social mobility in the US
* relatively high social mobility as in other high income countries
6. explain poverty patterns and trend of economic inequality in the US
* 13.5% are classified as poor, among them 47% are under 25
7. explain social stratification
* the hierarchical trait of society
8. compare caste and class system; implication on members?
* in caste systems, status is ascribed, and there is a strong emphasis on tradition/duty/beliefs/culture; in the sense that people have a duty to act and work as they are mandated by society to do; there is little social mobility and the aristocracy has complete power over commoners; societal potential is not achieved becuase there is less incentive for individuals to attempt climbing the social ladder
* class systems operate by meritocracy; the more compentent achieve higher roles; the people who work harder/smarter achieve higher roles; there is high social mobility and class systems are present in industrial and postindustrial societies
9. characteristics of class system
* equality is increased because society offers unequal rewards based on performance
* not a pure meritocracy for the stability of society...
10. what kind of system is the US; how does inequality appear in comparison to other high income nations
* class system
* this chapter doesn't provide statistics on other high income nations, so I will answer from analysis. Currently big corporations are dominating the scene of social stratification, making wealth the main driver of social stratification. I'd say... the US has a good share of big prominent corporations relative to other high income nations - in comparison to those, I guess... the US is more unequal?
11. iterate wealth inequality and distribution in the US
* 89% wealth in hands of top 20%
12. explain how sociology paradigms affect stratification; explain Davis Moore's hypothesis, and Weber's multidimensional approach in relation to paradigms
* Davis Moore analyzes from structural functional point of view: stratification is a necessary trait of society because it promotes stability; since higher class is allocated for those of higher performance in an industrial/post industrial society, there are proper incentives to achieving the best potential of society
* Weber's view was social conflict(according to textbook), but in my opinion, it appears like a structural functional perspective. Perhaps because his view was a continuation and revision of Marx's view: the og of socialism(social conflict theory gone bad). 
* Weber analyzed stratification from two different aspects: wealth and social aspects. The social aspects include power and status. Where aristocracy reigns, ascribed status drives stratification. In the age of robber barons and big corporations, wealth drives stratification. Where there are big, unchecked governments, power drives stratification.
13. explain status consistency and how it appears in class and caste systems
* status consistency represents the degree of correlation among indexes of class: wealth, power, status. Caste systems have high status consistency because the people of ascribed status had all the power, and they used it to gather wealth. Class systems have lower status consistency because there is more opportunity and more career paths; the one with high status may not be the one with highest wealth.
14. explain Ehrenreich's 'Nickel and Dimed: on not getting by in america' and how it demonstrates inability for low income families to support themselves
* ehrenreich experienced the life of the low-poor and realized that hard, minimum wage work at convenience stores and warehouses was insufficient to support livelihood.
15. explain federal poverty levels and statistics; deep poverty levels and statistics; which class and race in greatest poverty?
* 2019, $25,750/yr for a family of four was the federal poverty line;
* 13.5% ppl classified as poor; among them people younger than 25 accounted for 48%
16. statistics of impoverished in the US 2015-2019, especially where it peaked at during covid 
* in order of years from 2015+: [13.5%, 12.6%, 12.4%, 11.9%, 10.5%, 11.6%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/233138/number-of-people-living-below-the-poverty-in-the-us/)
17. iterate statistics on wealth and income distribution
* top 20% has 89% wealth, 48% income
18. what are 4 principles that underlie social stratification
* it is a trait of society, carrying across generations, it is universal but varied, it varies by belief system

### Social Stratification
* Some statistics on being born into poverty(to a married couple): 6% whites, 11% blacks, 20% hispanics
* Stats on being born into poverty to single mother: 35% whites, 46% blacks, 49% hispanics(add 30% to above category)
* social stratification is important because it effects all aspects of our lives
* how gender and class affected chances of survival during the Titanic: 80% dead were men, 60+% first class passengers survived, 36% second class survived, 24% third class survived because they were on lower decks
### key concepts
1. concept of caste, class and meritocracy to societies around world
* `social stratification` is about how people are ranked in societal hierarchy: social stratification is a trait of society and carries to the next generation, it is universal but varies-sometimes it varies by belief system(it also varies in terms of what it values: some societies value prestige, others wealth, others power)
2. caste system
* `ascription` based social stratification; typical of agrarian societies because it demands hard labor, and it is simpler to make people belive that they must do hard labor because it is their duty and an essential part of their belief system
* in India, caste system based on Hindu beliefs: ppl are stratified by varnas/class(Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra)
* Africa apartheid/racial separation; rule of whites subjugation of blacks
* caste systems waste human potential because roles are assigned before individuals can realize their talents
* caste system 'assign' roles so it promotes stability and order; certain aspects are maintained in modern society in the US for this stability(rather than becoming perfect meritocracy), ie. wealth passign down generations
3. class system
* social stratification that is based on both birth and individual merit -> `meritocracy`: based on personal merit
* there has become necessity of specialized talents in various fields rather than just hard labor, thus gave rise to class sytem
* industrial societies expanded equality of opportunity by giving unequal rewards based on individual eprformance
* pure meritocracy would have people moving up and down the social ladder all the time and society would lack statbility = the extreme of `social mobility`
*`status consistency`: is an individual's deviation of social-standing-position across different measures of social inequality; low `status consistency` means that it is hard to define individual's social position, since there is higher social mobility and there are different measurements of social position
* an example being, professors enjoying prestige but having low incomes
4. caste and class: the UK
* during UK's long agrarian history, aristocracy ruled in a caste system, where church leaders were of first estate, the rest of aristocracy in second estate; these two groups ruled over the commoners; 
* aristocrats devised `primogeniture` law to maintain social class of their families; so property wouldn't be divided among heirs
* in the modern UK, there are still monarchs and families that inherit vast wealth and power, but not as much as before(Earl Spencer selling one of his titles-lord of wimbledon- to raise money for plumbing)
5. classless societies. the former Soviet Union
* USSR, union of soviet social republics, borne out of 1917 russian revolution that removed federal estate systems(following in lead of Marx, who believed private property was the source of social stratification)
* the result was not removal of stratification, rather changing the priveleged status from those who had property to those who held government power - the `appraratchiks`
* 1985 mikhail gorbachev attempted economic reform by reducing centralized control of economy -> it didn't work and it led to resurgence, and 1991 Russian Federation replaced the USSR
* in Russia's industrial age, `structural social mobility` happened as the previously poor rural peasants moved to cities and earned greater wealth; but in 1990s economy turned downwards again
6. China: emerging social classes
* 1949 mao zedong declared all work equally important so the state took control of all productive property, creating a class of the very powerful political elite
* Deng xiaoping 1978 loosened hold on economy and a new class of business owners emerged
* 2012 Xi jingping led the Chinese Communist Pary
* China was shifted from centralized control to market system, leading to rapid economic growth
* the new class system: consists of old Party hierarchy, a new business hierarchy, and a class of very well connected people
7. ideology: the power behind stratification
* ideology and cultrue maintained stratification; Plato: every culture considers some type of inequality fair; Marx: capital societies defend stratification by 'law of the marketplace' and the right to own property results creates institutions of elites
* historical patterns leading up to now: in agrarian societies, people labored because of duty and responsibilitiy; in industrial capitalism and meritocracy, status is won by personal merit and the poor are seen as personally undeserving(Herbert Spencer)

### Theories of Social Inequality
* Davis and Moore: stratification is vital part in society operation; structural functionalism
#### key concepts
1. apply sociology's major theories to topic of social inequality
2. structural functional: the davis moore thesis
* stratification is in every society because it is good for society's operation; the more important the functional importance of a position, the more rewards society attaches to it
* any society could be egalitarian if the people are willing to let `anyone` perform `any` job
* contrasting views of equality demand that someone who does work well gets rewarded similarly to someone who does work poorly; there is no incentive to do well and society's `productive efficiency` is sacrificed
* criticism: Melvin Tumin: 1)how do you assess the importance of a particular work? Perhaps society deliberately places certain people in the `important` work; 2)social stratification prevents individuals from reaching their potential; 3)overemphasis on money directs us to the `money` jobs rather than `important` jobs; 4)davis moore thesis ignores how this inequality harms society by promoting conflict
3. social conflict: Marx and Weber
* Marx: aristocratics replaced by `capitalists` and peasants replaced by `proletariats`; he was alive during era of robber barons Carnegie, JP Morgan, Astor... Marx believed that work under capitalism only produced `alienation` and that the proletariats would eventually overthrow capitalism...
* criticism: ignores that a system of unequal rewards is central to reaching society's potential because it encourages people to work hard and work smart
* defenders: .......xd...humanity is social rather than selfish and individuals have other incentives to work hard rather than individual rewards
* Why no marxist revolution? Ralf Dahrendorm suggests: 1)fragmentation of capitalist class, corporations owned by shareholders; 2)higher standards of living; 3)more legal protections; 4)workers organizations
* defenders: wealth highly concentrated in capitalist US, 37% private property in hands of 1%
* marx viewed social prestige and power as a simple reflection of the inequality of society

* `weber's socioeconomic status hierarchy/multimentional view of social stratigication`: economic inequality, status, and power are distinct categories/dimensions of inequality and shoule be treated separately
* noted that status consistency in modern societies were quite low: high officials with low salary
* historically, agrarian societies distinguished class by social prestige, by which members of prestige conform to norms that apply to their particular rank; industrial/capitalist societies based on economic level; bigger government and other big organizations led to power being the rising stratification dimension
* weber's analysis of socialism: it may reduce economic differences, but it is just shifting stratification to another dimension: from money to power -> socialism just leads to powerful political elites
* critics: whine that the post industrail society is still very unequal
4. symbolic interaction: stratification in everyday life
* micro level analysis is important because stratification results in class, and people interact differently based on class
* to see patterns of social inequality in everyday interactions;
* limitations: how and why broad patterns of social inequality exist

### Tech and Social Stratification

#### key concepts
1. link society's tech to social stratification
* from Gerhard Lenski's model of sociocultural evolution
2. hunting and gathering societies
* people struggling with survival and had to survive by sharing; no stratification
3. horticultural pastoral agrarian societies
* with surplus, an elite class appeared and took control of surplus; nobility has godlike position over the masses
4. industrial societies
* meritocracy takes hold and weakens power of `ascribed` elites
* wealth is less concentrated: 1920s 1% owned 40% wealth, 1980s 1% owned 30s%
5. kuznets curve
* industrialization increases, then moderates social stratification
* from a functional perspective, agrarian societies needed inequality, while industrial socities do better with more wealth-and-status distribution
* criticism: Kuznets curve was developed by comparing socities of different levels of economic development = `cross sectional data`; current post-industrial increase in social stratification went contrary to Kuznet's curve

* I think that at certain levels of wealth/status/prestige, there is a tendency towards centralization of resourses and wealth to individuals who have the power to do so... since it is human nature to want the best for oneself

### Inequality and Social Class 

#### key concepts
1. distribution of income and wealth in the US
* better wealth, better health(and also other stuff that doesn't rhyme: ie schooling, goods consumed...)
2. income, wealth, power
* top 20% of families get 48.6% of income; bottom 20% get 3.6%
* median income $70,697(2016)
* wealth distribution greater than income
* 20% has 89% wealth
3. occupational prestige
* prestiguous occupations go to more priveleged categories of people
4. schooling
* 2015, 88% graduate high school, 33% graduate college
5. ancestry, race, gender
* the typical... certain categories are more priveleged
6. social classes in the US
* top 5% earn at minimum $239,000/yr
* 40-45% in middle class: $134,000 - 238,000/yr
* 33% working class: $30,000 - $55,000/yr
* 20% lower class: : 76% complete high school, 15% complete college
7. difference that class makes
* health, values, politics, family
* social capital is passed down generations

### Social Mobility

#### key concepts

1. extent of social mobility in the US
2. research on mobility
* since 2007 recession, social mobility in the US went down
3. moblility: income level
* top 20%: 1980 earned $134,919; 2015 earned $225,279
* lowest 20%: saw 1% decrease in income(adjusted for inflation)

* note that the textbook adjusted the bottom percentage for inflation, but didn't adjust the top percentage to inflation... obviously the writers of this textbook had an agenda in mind
* if adjusted for the average historical inflation, $134,919 in 1980 is about the same as $224,279 in 2015 (doing a crude calculation with 3%)
4. mobility: race, ethnicity, gender
* the uninteresting typical... there are more priveleged categories
5. mobility, marriage
* couples can share expenses and accumulate twice the wealth as those who remain single; they also work harder for their families
6. the american dream
* earnings have stalled for many workers, many jobs are low income, 2007 recession brought economic decline, young people are not working... these are bad implications for the american dream
7. global economy and US class structure
* a global economy is more competitive in terms of earning wages, in terms of creating goods...
* global economy drives upward social mobility for many in the specialized labor markets

### Poverty and the Trend towards Increasing Inequality
* 2019: $25,750(family of 4) was fed poverty line
* richest 20% have 89% wealth
* Barbara Ehrenreich: spent months waitering, cleaning, working at discount store->these jobs didn't provide a living wage
* 43 million americans, 13.5% americans: classified as poor; 70% of them complete high school and 15% attned college; 43% own homes in rural south and others are working poor 

* 13.5% classified as poor; 45% are < 25 years old; 66% are white(although in relation, blacks are more likely to be poor)
* 44% head of households work some
#### key concepts

1. patterns of poverty and increasing economic inequality in the US
* social stratification creates `haves` and `have nots`
* stratification creates `relative poverty`
* the real problem, however, is `absolute poverty` and a lack of life-serving resources
2. extent of poverty
* federal poverty line: $24,257/yr(3x what ppl must spend for food; $66/day)
* but the average poor family had $13,000/yr($2/day)
3. who are the poor
* the old: 30% impoverished 1967, 8.8% in 2015;; accounts for 9.7% of the poor
* the young: 46.8% of the poor are 1-24

----- the below are self explanatory

4. explaining poverty
5. the working poor
6. homelessness
7. trend to increasing inequality
8. are the very rich worth the money
9. can the rest get ahead?

### notes
* key pattern for change: schooling and specialization(earning), legal rights(protecting what you earn), economic mobility(the result)
* human potential is exponential, as reflected by wealth distribution levels; the increase in wealth by class level is not proportional to brute size... an individual has more to leverage at every higher level he achieves, and that is used to achieve more - his growth is exponential
