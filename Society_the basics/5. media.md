* agrarian age: land was at center of economy; agriculture products from serf labor made nobles/landowners wealthy
* industrial age: factories at center of economy; wealth to capitalist factory owners
* postindustrial economy: production and distribution of symbols and information at center of economy; shifting from producing `things` to producing `ideas`; `media consolidation` perpetuates the class system= 90% US media owned by elite corporations(1983)

`social conflict approach focuses on:`the class focus of large media, but also has a mainly progressive agenda
