### PART1: SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

#### Q&A:

1. how does sociological perspective help us know how society shapes our lives?
* we can identify patterns of social behavior on ourselves and on the people around us; the patterns are: general in the particular, strange in the familiar
* sociology and history intertwines, societal change is the foundation of history, and we are shaped by this type of societal change

2. what advantage does knowing the sociological perspective/imagination provide? 
* understand how individual problems relate to social problems
* understand how our society relates to the larger global society

#### KEY IDEAS:

1. `sociology` = study of human society
2. `society` = ppl in certain territory/culture
3. `general in the particular`: general patterns in a particular group of people; ie. obesity in the US, Generation RX(ADHD medication for boys), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in NFL players
4. `strange in the familiar`: love is not strange as it is shaped by social expectation, and things are not always as they seem...
5. `society in our everyday life`: society determins suicide rates since suicide rates are determined by the level of social integration. Men, protestants, and the wealthier(the categories with less social integration) are more likely to suicide than those who experience more social integration: women, catholics, jews, poor, the married(Durkheim)
6. `marginality and crisis`: people living on the marigins, and people living in times of crisis tend to better understand the impact of society on our lives(the sociological perspective)
7. `a global perspective`: understanding the role of your society in the larger global society due to an increasingly interconnected world
8. `origins of sociology`: 18-19th century, where industrial revolution was greatest, there was most societal change, and there was also the most development in sociology. The major changes were: growth of cities, economy became factory based and workers became part of an interpersonal system-of-parts production line, political change, new scientific discoveries
9. `auguste compte's 3 stages of society`: the theological society in which church was authority, the metaphysical society during the enlightenment, and the society of the scientific stage. Compte was a believer of the scientific approach(positivist sociology)


### PART2: THEORY
#### Q&A:
1. what is the historical context of sociology? 
* the development of sociology was spurred by social change in the 18-19th century, as people moved away from traditional ways of life into cities, factories, and a new, impersonal society
* key changes were the growth of cities, the industrial revolution, and political movements for individual rights
* Auguste Compte describes this in "three stages of society": 1. theological, 2. metaphysical, 3. scientific; Compte believes that in the modern, scientific stage, we should use a positivist/scientific approach to sociology, that society is dominated by certain laws just as the physical world does by laws of nature

2. what are sociology's three main research orientations/paradigms? describe.
* structural functional approach: sees society as a system of gears that work together and promote stability
* social conflict approach: sees society as brewing ground for inequality, conflict, and ultimately, change for the better
* symbolic interaction approach: sees society as a huge collection of individual social interactions; people in society are like actors on a stage, playing the roles they 'should' play

#### KEY IDEAS:

1. `structural functional approach`: 

society is a system of interconnected parts, working together for stability and order. Thinkers are: Compte, Spencer, Durkheim. Compte believed that tradition was disappearing, making it more important to maintain social unity. Spencer analogized the society to the human body, a system of interdependent structural and internal components.

`Merton on social function`: manifest and latent functions. `social dysfunction` happens when social patterns disrupt the operaiton of society.

`structural functionalists believe`: social change is disruptive, but something good may come out of it(like the economic boom after WWII)

2. `social conflict approach`: society is unequal and it is a brewing ground of conflict and change. Particularly, gender and race conflict; but conflict is good because it leads to change

thinkers: Weber, Marx, Simmel

The early Marx had a commmunist inclination; the later Marx realized that he was wrong->industrialization was bringing improvement to all 

`social conflicters believe`: soicology should focus on inequality, because unequal stuff like class, race, gender and age is linked to money, power, education and social prestige. 

`social conflicters ignore`: unification brought by shared values and culture; and in the pursuit of change, social conflicters lose objectivity and become ideological robots, which is contrary to what they are attempting to achieve

3. `symbolic interaction`: society is a collection of individual social interactions. This is a micro level approach to sociology

thinkers: mead, goffman, garfinkel. Mead says, personality develops on social experience. Goffman says, we are like actors on a stage, playing our social roles. 

`symbolic interactionists focus on`: individuals in society
`symbolic interactionists ignore`: widespread trends in society like culture and social class

### PART3: METHODS AND ETHICS IN RESEARCH
#### Q&A:
1. what are the three research orientations of sociology, and what methods are used by each?[I guess sociologists wanted two names for pretty much the same thing since they have nothing better to do, paradigm/approach/research orientation/method]
* structural functional = positivist sociology
* social conflict = critical sociology
* symbolic interaction = interpretive sociology

2. why is ethics imporant in research?
* because humans have empathy for other humans

#### KEY IDEAS:

1. `positivist sociology`: based on empirical evidence; structural functionalist; researchers should be neutral and objective and they should follow the scientific method

Weber: at the same time, researchers must remember that they too are influenced by their own socil background

2. `cruttttical sociology`: society is not a natural system and it is unequal and it should be changed

3. `interpretive sociology`: reality is subjective, and so our experiences in society are subjective; so in order to understand society, researchers should interact with people and attempt to interpret these subjective experiences

Weber's `Verstehen`: interpretive, empathic study of sociology

4. `research ethics`:

some unethical studies: milgram obedience, tuskegee syphilis, laud humphrey's tearoom sex

`response to unethical studies`: Belmont report, institutional review boards -> `the rules`: no physical, psychological, emotional pain to human participants; must have participant consent; must have confidentiality
