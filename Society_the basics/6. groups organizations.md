## Chapter 6: groups and organizations

`the power of society to link people into groups and social groups`

Membership in groups and organizations is a reflection of the organization of society; socia class influences the groups you join; people who identify as upper class were 5x more likely to be members of professional organization than working class; almost none in lower class reported to be part of such an organization.

1948, Maurice and Richard McDonald created concept of `fast food`-> their success story is more than the popularity of unhealthy food; it is about the organizational principles that brought the company to success and is similarly dominating our social lives

### Q&A
1. why are various types of groups important to social life? Iterate
* primary groups are composed of close, personal interactions, experienced early in life; the most important primary group in society is family
* secondary groups are composed of more impersonal interactions, more goal oriented and has stricter rules
* ingroups and outgroups result in sharper self identities for members of groups; it gives in group members a sense of community and at the same time it causes stratification among different groups
* reference groups are a strategy for anticipatory socialization
2. Describe operation of large formal organizations
* efficiency comes first in terms of routine tasks, leading to specialization and more repetition and more rules
* in traditional bureaucracy: hierarchical, rule based, competence based, written formal communication, specialization, impersonalization
3. explain changes to formal organizations over last century	
* during initial phases of industrial revolution, it is true that high-efficiency technology was created, but it was like high grade fuel running on an old car
* the human-organization system was the old car that couldn't use the high efficiency technology to its greatest capacity
* this led to development of streamlined, efficiency-first bureaucracies; the scientific-management method in which workers worked like gears in a machine, in a highly specialized and efficient system of parts
* new technology is continually developed and the manual-labor age is replaced by the information age(the nature of work has changed), and now we are coming closer to the next stage of bureaucratic development: the flexible management system in which creativity and competiton is valued over strict hierarchy
4. explain the social structure diagram and iterate thru levels
* the social structure diagram provided is composed of three levels: the micro, mezzo, and macro. The micro deals with individual encounters and small primary group interactions, the mezzo deals with bigger secondary groups like communities and organizations, the macro deals with bigger issues in society as a whole(ie stratification, institutions)
* structural embeddedness increases as you go towards the macro because larger groups consist of more social relations, and there is a tendency to steer away from personal casual relationships in exchange for impersonal, goal oriented relationships; (as I understand it) structural constraint decreases as you go towards the macro because more can be accomplished in larger groups, when at the micro level there is very little that can be leveraged towards a specific goal(a person becomes limited by their own faculties; like the strength of their arms in lifting a box in the warehouse)
5. describe and apply structural constraint and structural embeddedness
* generally, structural constraint and structural embeddedness are inversely proportional... I use proportional for lack of a better term, but there is nothing specific or numeric about these terms - it's just that structural constraint decreases when group size increases, and structural embeddedness increases when group size increases
* our activities are embedded in a network of social relationships, and of course, there are more social relationships when the group is bigger, and it becomes more necessary to take account of social relationships in the decision making and operation of larger groups
6. describe different groups and their characteristics
* ingroup/outgroup results in sharper self identity, reference groups represent the `anticipatory self`, primary groups involve personal interactions, secondary groups are larger and becomes more rule based nad impersonal

* in the case that this question includes organization types, there are three organization types, distinguished by reason for participation: utilitarian is for pay(like a job) and it is voluntary, coercive is involuntary and often born-into, normative groups are for some specific interest or goal and is voluntary
7. explain Simmel's dyads and triads
* dyads are personal relationships of two, like marriages; interaction is typically more intense but unstable
* triads are more stable because one individual can serve as mediation person, but triads can dissolve into a dyad when one feels excluded
8. explain different kinds of leadership style
* authoritative leaders issue commands and is efficient(a good authoritative leader), democratic leadership takes note of including everyone in the decision making process but is inefficient, laissez faire is free reign and it is unlikely to achieve tasks as a whole
9. explain Asch's research, relevance?
* Asch had a group of people observe lines on a piece of paper, with one line obviously longer than the others. There was only one experiment subject, the others in the group were preinformed to choose a wrong line. In the end, 1/3 experiment subjects chose to conform to the wrong line rather than trusting their own vision
* people don't just conform to personal groups, they also conform to strangers rather than believing in their own initial judgement
10. explain Milgram's research, relevance?
* milgram had actors who pretended to get electric shocked by experiment subjects; the experiment subjects were demanded by an `authoritative figure` to increase the electric shock to dangerous levels, and 2/3 subjects complied
11. explain Janis' groupthink process
* groupthink explains the tendency of groups to come up with narrow discussion results because the group conforms to one another down a similar avenue of thought
* groupthink is particularly prevalent among those with similar beliefs and goals, like the US cabinet?
12. explain what Janis found about jury decision making
* groupthink happens in groups of high cohesiveness
13. identify and explain 3 organizational models
* the 3 organization models are distinguished by reason that individuals are in the group; utilitarian is voluntary and for some individual benefit like salary, normative is voluntary and for some goal(like volunteer organizations), coercive organizations are involuntary like prison camps
14. explain social networks, Milgram's work on social networks, and the impact of SES and gender
* social networks form a fuzzy connection between a large group of people; if you imaging people as being nodes on a graph, each node/person connects to many other nodes. In this scheme, the growth of this graph is exponential(to the factor of the average amount of ppl each person knows)
* the point being, the world is smaller than many think, when in terms of networks; Milgram found that there was only `six degrees of separation` between strangers in Kansas and Nebraska to Boston
* networks are based on the individual's sphere of interaction... so it is impacted by gender because social interaction is different across gender... so it is impacted by socioeconomic status because social interaction varies across class; also, people of a similar class tend to interact more with one another in ingroups
15. explain Etzioni's classification of organizations
* already answered above, but will answer again
* etzioni classifies organizations based on ppl's reason for joining the group; there is the coercive organization that is involuntary and often born into; there is the normative organization that is voluntary and for some worthwhile purpose(like a volunteer organization), there is the utilitarian organization that is joined for some practical purpose like salary for livelihood
16. explain bureaucracy characteristics, goals, and what knowledge type it is based on (rational vs traditional)
* bureaucracy strives for efficiency, so it must be rule regulated, it must have formal written communication; it must have placement based on competence rather than relationships; it must be specialized for further efficiency as are any system of parts; it is impersonal because it works like an efficient machine, and machines don't care about your feelings
* modern flexible bureaucracy comes from the scientific management form of bureaucracy, which is definitely rational and contrary to the traditional forms of management/knowledge
17. explain problems with bureaucracy
* bureaucracy is impersonal and inefficient, and has a tendency to oligarchy; although it tries to be efficient, it has way too many useless rules and work is way too boring for people to be incentivized to be enthusiastic for their work(everyone has had a similar experience at DMV...)
* the traditional bureaucracy is rigid in hierarchy so it has a tendency to form an oligarchy, in which many are ruled by a few(whom are likely to act in personal interst as anyone long in power does)
18. explain mcdonaldization
* the american heritage of fast food culture in a fast food society...:p our society is geared for efficiency, producing output that is controlled, predictable, uniform, efficient (and unsurprising)
19. explain changes to formal organization alongside industrialization
* industrialization meant that people and information could travel longer distances and faster; people came out of their rural farm homes into crowded cities for work, and crowded = lots of people = need for regulation = plenty of labor supply for a system-of-parts style workflow
* this had many implications for bureaucracy; there was the need to organize these people, and there was a need to make these people efficient; so there was rules for operation and rules for communication, and there was people to implement rules in a hierarchical bureaucratic structure. These bureaucracies strove to be efficient, so they hired competent people rather than people who were in their families, and so a massive workforce becomes part of an ever more impersonal factory system

### social groups

#### key concepts
1. the importance of various types of groups to social life
* in the 20th century, scope of group life expanded in scale from families and neighborhood groups to formal bureucracies and corporations
2. primary and secondary groups
* 1864-1929 Charles Horton Cooley: primary groups are composed of primary relationships, are experienced early in life, have a `personal orientation` in which people care for one another personally, with family being the most important primary group in society; long term; ends in themselves; involves many activities done together
* secondary groups are `goal oriented` and doesn't have much of a personal connection; few activities done together, typically short term, means to an end
3. group leadership
`leadership category by task/goal`
* instrumental leadership focuses on completion of tasks
* expressive leadership focuses on well being of members
`leadership category by decision making style`
* authoritarian leadership makes demands
* democratic leadership more expressive, includes everyone in decision making
* laissez faire (leave it alone in French) leadership is least effective in achieving group goals
4. group conformity
* groups encourage conformity; so do strangers(Asch and Milgram research)
* `Asch's Research`: a third of subjects chose to conform rather than trusting their vision
* `Milgram's Research`: 2/3 of subjects went up to dangerous electric voltage
* `Janis's Groupthink`: groupthink results in narrow view of issues because of members' tendency to conform to certain lines of thought; more likely to happen when members have similar attitudes, so this happened a lot with the US foreign policy group(Bay of Pigs, Pearl Harbor, Vietnam)
5. reference groups
* conforming to groups we don't belong to = strategy to win acceptance = strategy for `anticipatory socialization`
* reference group is point of reference in making decisions, like an individual girl considering what her family would think of her new boyfriend
* `Stouffer's Research`: researchers asked soldiers to rate their likelihood of promotion; soldiers in units with low promotion rates were more optmistic about getting promoted -> the point being, we form a subjective sense of ourselves by looking at ourselves relative to specific reference groups
6. in groups and out groups
* in groupers get a sense of respect and loyalty
* out groupers get a sense of competition/opposition
* tensions sharpen each groups' identities; and better to do groups look down on worse to do groups -> ingroup and outgroups foster loyalty but also generates conflict
7. group size
* `dyad`: Gorge Simmel(1858-1918) studied small group dynamics; dyad = relationship of 2 people; social interaction in dyad is more intense and personal than in larger groups
* `triad`: group of three; one can act as mediator; if two get together, the third feels lseft out
* as groups get larger, it becomes more impersonal, and more focus on formal rules and regulation
8. social diversity: race, class, gender; how these classifications change group dynamics
* race, class, gender plays part in group dynamics
* `large groups turn inwards`: as an example when college brings in many international students to promote diversity; at a large number these international students will only interact amongst themselves, thus increasing separatism
* `heterogeneous groups turn outwards`: the more diverse it is within a group, the more likely that members will interact with outsiders
* `physical boundaries create social boundaries`: if not interacting physically, not interacting socially...
9. networks: 
* networks are social capital
* Milgram's `six degrees of separation`; although results can't be generalized to the public
10. social media and networking
* social media is a networking technology

### formal organizations

#### key concepts
1. operation of large formal organizations
* large formal organizations are secondary, goal oriented groups
2. type of formal orgnizations
* Amitai Etzioni 1975 identified three formal organization types, destinguished by reason for participation:
* 1) utilitarian organizations: of choice, done for payment
* 2) normative organizations: for some purpose, voluntary
* 3) coercive organizations: involuntary
3. origins of formal orgnaization
* there was formal organizations before industrialization and the information revolution, however they had two limitations. The first being travel and the communication/store of information, the second being culture: culture prevents change and limits efficiency
* `Weber, Rationalization of Society`: turn away from tradition to rationality as main type of thought, in which efficiency is encouraged -> modern society becomes disenchanted that sentimal ties have lost to rational focus on the scientific method and structures of 'bureaucracy'
4. characteristics of bureaucracy
* bureaucracy is an organizational model designed for efficiency; it has a couple of characteristics: rules, hierarchy, formal communication, competence(instead of hiring relatives and such), specialization, impersonality
5. organizational environment
* organization is impacted by a lot of outside factors like other organizations, technology, economic/political trends, population pattern/workforce
6. the informal side of bureaucracy
* Weber's ideal democracy is rigid and regulates every activity, but...
* people often break free of rigid rules and `personalize their surroundings`: `grapevines` = informal networks;
7. problems of bureaucracy
* alienation/dehumanization, and bureaucratic inefficiency/ritualism, and bureaucratic inertia
* peter principle: people promoted to level of inefficiency
* parkinsons principle: work expands to fill time allocated for it
8. oligarchy
* rule of many by the few; Weber: this type of strict hierarchy for maximum efficiency; Robert Michels(1876-1936): concentrates power and threatens democracy, officials will use their privilege access to resource for their own interest

### evolution of formal organization

#### key concepts
1. changes to formal organization over a century
* problems of bureaucracy(dehumanization and oligarchical tendency) are a result of organizational rigidity and hierarchy
* Weber belived in the top-down, chain-of-command type system, led to development of `scientific management`
2. scientific management
* `scientific management`: Frederick Taylor 1911 noted that businesses were still relying on tired skills of previous generations - they had new technology running on an old organizational system, which didn't output good efficiency -> this led to scientific management, which involves 3 steps.
* `scientific management steps`: 1. identify tasks, including input, thruput time, and output; 2. analyze data and find ways to improve efficiency; 3. management provides proper incentives and rules for the improved method to take hold
* but now things are changing; race and gender challenges are appearing, rising competition from abroad, and the nature of work is changing
3. the first challenge: race and gender
* white men have a 61% representation in senior management(tbh this statistic means little by itself)
* the female advantage: women have an `information focus` whereas men have an `image focus` (personal image); women are more flexible leaders and emphasize interconnectedness of operations
4. the second challenge: the japanese work organization
* Honda's surpassing of US automakers: reflects the collective spirit in corporations; the corporations are more like large primary groups than secondary groups
* William Ouchi 1981 highlights 5 differences in formal organization: 1) new workers are hired in groups and all have same responsibilities and salary, 2) worker hired for life, sense of loyalty, 3) workers trained in all phases of operations, 4) quality circles for workers to discuss decisions, 5) companies provide for home mortages, recreational activities, social events...
* a lot of it is changing now though
5. the third challenge: the challenging nature of work
* the equal opportunity pressure
* shift away from manual labor to information communication
* `flexible organization` is composed of CEO, senior manager group, and numberous competing work teames; whereas the conventional bureucracy had a strict structure of ceo, top execs, division leaders, middle managers....
6. the Mcdonalidization of society
* four principles of modern society: 1) efficiency(Ray Krok, McDonald's marketing genius), 2) Control, 3) Predictability, 4) Uniformity
7. the future of organizations: opposing trends
* I'm not sure how the contents of this section relate to its title... I guess, this section is all about technological development that is taking out the necessity for low-level workers who do routine tasks, and instead companies are turning to creative individuals who are capable of abstracting and creating new project ideas. So it is a trend that opposes the impersonal-ness and rigidity of traditional bureaucracy
